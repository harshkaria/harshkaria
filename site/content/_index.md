This is mainly a platform for me to showcase my technical projects, share insights on machine learning, and archive my thoughts chronologically. 

I am currently a graduate student studying Computer Science, focusing on machine learning at the University of Southern California, based in Los Angeles. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science in 2020. I have built distributed enterprise services, pipelines, iOS apps, and machine learning models. My primary technology stacks are Angular and Nest.js for purely web development; I like FastAPI if I want to add REST behind ML models in Python. For ML itself, I work in PyTorch across GPU clouds for training. In my free time, I like to travel and explore the outdoors.
